# User LLM API Guide

Language: English | [简体中文](zh-CN/user-guide.md) | [日本語](ja/user-guide.md)

This guide is for employees and application developers who call approved large language models through TokenHub.

## What You Need

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | OpenAI-compatible endpoint root, for example `http://localhost:8080/v1` |
| Project API Key | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY` |
| Model ID | Returned by `GET /v1/models` and used as the `model` field |
| Request ID | Used in Request Logs when troubleshooting failures |

Console login tokens cannot call model APIs. Use a project API key from **Key Management**.

## Call Sequence

1. Open **Key Management** and choose the project that should own usage and cost.
2. Create or copy a project API key. New keys are shown only once.
3. Call `GET /v1/models` to see the model list available to that key.
4. Use one model ID in `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/responses`, or `POST /v1/embeddings`.
5. Review **Usage Analytics** and **Request Logs** for requests, tokens, cost, and errors.

## List Models

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/models" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Typical model fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Model identifier used in API calls |
| `object` | Object type, usually `model` |
| `context_size` | Maximum context window when configured |
| `input_token_price_per_m` | Input price per million tokens when configured |
| `output_token_price_per_m` | Output price per million tokens when configured |

## Chat Completions

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKENHUB_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are an internal enterprise AI assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize today'\''s support tickets."}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "stream": false
  }'
```

Common request fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | Yes | Must be available in `GET /v1/models` |
| `messages` | Yes | `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message list |
| `max_tokens` | No | Maximum generated tokens |
| `temperature` | No | Sampling temperature |
| `stream` | No | `true` returns Server-Sent Events |
| `tools` | No | Function tools when supported by the upstream model |
| `response_format` | No | JSON object or JSON schema when supported |

## SDK Setup

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.TOKENHUB_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "http://localhost:8080/v1",
});
```

## Troubleshooting

| Status | Likely cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | Missing, malformed, disabled, or expired API key | Check `Authorization` and key status |
| 403 | Project, key, or model permission does not allow the request | Ask your team leader to check project membership and model access |
| 404/503 | No enabled healthy route can serve the model | Ask an administrator to check routes and provider health |
| 429 | Quota, concurrency, or provider resource limit reached | Wait for reset or request a quota increase |
| 500 | Upstream provider or routing error | Search `request_id` in Request Logs |
